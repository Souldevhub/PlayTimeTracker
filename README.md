### 🛠️ Placeholder Usage Tips

1. **Reward IDs**:
   - Use the exact ID from your config.yml
   - Case-sensitive (level_5 ≠ Level_5)
   - Replace spaces with underscores

2. **Formatting**:
   - All time values are formatted as `Xd Yh Zm Ws`
   - Empty values are omitted (e.g., `2h 30s` instead of `0d 2h 0m 30s`)

3. **Next Reward Logic**:
   - `%playtime_required%` shows either:
     - The next reward in progression (requires more playtime than current)
     - The highest reward player has qualified for but not claimed
   - This provides more intuitive information than simply showing the lowest unclaimed reward

- 🌟 Particle effects for reward claiming
- 🐛 Debug mode for easier troubleshooting
- ➕ More features coming soon

  - All sounds play at standard volume (1.0) and pitch (1.0)
  - Custom heads can be added using `headId` with Base64 texture values
  - Specify which page a reward should appear on using the `page` parameter (starting from 0)
  - Navigation buttons can use custom player heads with `headId` parameter
  - GUI slots and slots per page are configurable
  - AFK protection settings:
    - `interaction-threshold`: Minimum number of interactions required in the time window
    - `time-window-minutes`: Time window in minutes to check for interactions

    - Language files automatically copied to plugin directory for customization
  - Debug mode:
